# rpg-character
A lightweight roleplaying game (RPG) character system in Swift.

### Purpose
A library that implements an RPG system I thought up. The goal is to encapsulate the core concepts in an API that is concise, generalized, and reasonable.

### Concepts
1. A character is defined by a collection of named attributes.
2. Attributes have a baseline value.
3. User defined events modify attributes.
4. The default event, a time step, causes attributes to decay toward the baseline.

### Usage
API design is still in its early stages. I will add usage examples and documentation once I feel like it's more secure.
